Before:
  source test/utils.vim
  source test/mock/provider.vim

  let provider = GetProvider()
  let buffer_number = bufnr('%')
  let window_number = winnr()

After:
  unlet! provider
  unlet! buffer_number
  unlet! window_number

Given(Buffer with some content):
  Some text.
  This is an example.
Execute(Test s:tree_wipe):
  vnew
  call yggdrasil#tree#new(provider)

  call b:yggdrasil_tree.wipe()

  AssertEqual buffer_number, bufnr('%')
  AssertEqual window_number, winnr()
Expect(Original buffer content is unchanged):
  Some text.
  This is an example.
